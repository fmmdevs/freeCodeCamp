# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta) Certification Progress

This repository serves as a log of my progress in the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta) Certification" course. I will be regularly updating it with my solutions as I work through the challenges. Please note that the solutions may vary as I am not only completing them on the freeCodeCamp website but also attempting to solve each step locally, independently, and in my own way.

## About the Course

Developers use HTML and CSS to control the content and styling of a page, and JavaScript to make that page interactive. In this certification, I am delving into the fundamentals of JavaScript and advanced concepts to enhance my web development skills.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by modules, each corresponding to a section of the course. You can explore my solutions.
